Anyone download YouTube videos on thee regular? I used to, still do occasionally, and was sick and tired of them sketchy websites, so I made my own local app. Figured I'd share if anyone is interested. 

No Longer Requires Own Installation of FFmpeg!!

Once done with that, just extract thee zip folder, and run thee .exe, input thee YouTube link, select res/audio only and hit download. 
Program will ask you to login via Google's auth page ( https://google.com/device ) in the open command prompt window and that is for age gated videos. 
Should only need to login once, and a token will be generated locally ( _internal/pytube/--cache-- (underscores, not dashes, text box don't like underscores)). 

Program now uses threading, so it's a lot more responsive and no more freezing while doing thee downloading/converting

if anyone has any questions, comments or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

Much Love
